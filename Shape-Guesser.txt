About Guess the Shape Game
Guess the Shape Game is an interactive web game where players 
try to identify randomly displayed shapes, such as circles, squares,
 or triangles. The game is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
without the use of external libraries or frameworks. Players input their
 guesses through text fields, buttons, or other interactive elements, 
and the game provides immediate feedback on whether the guess is correct.
 A score tracker keeps track of progress, and the shapes are displayed dynamically,
 often using the HTML5 Canvas or styled elements. 
This project is a great way to learn and practice core JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, 
event handling, and logic implementation while creating an engaging and visually appealing experience.
